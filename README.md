# A New Portfolio

This portfolio is a conversion of my existing, rudimentary portfolio originally developed using HTML & CSS. After graduating from my program, I wanted to upgrade in style and functionality, so I decided to create a React app and deploy it as a more professional and more advanced example of the work I can do.
