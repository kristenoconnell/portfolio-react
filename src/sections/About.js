        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Denver with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and two minors - Biology and French. I spent 3 months on a remote fishing island studying marine ecology and conservation. I completed a thesis on incarcerated juveniles and their parental relationships. And I'm coming off a multi-year stint in the service industry. So, how did I get here?

        <p>Even though my background seems a bit wide-ranged, it's actually all tied together by a few of my favorite and most important things: helping people, solving problems, and constantly learning new things.

            The future of software engineering is so bright. Technology is advancing in a way that solves real-world problems for people all over the world. And I would love to finish the rest of this later.
