            Hi there! I'm Kristen. I'm originally from a not-so-small town in Texas called Plano. I spent 5 years living in (and loving) Denver, Colorado before moving back home. I've been helping people and solving problems in the service industry for several years, and now I'm excited to continue helping people and solving problems as a software developer. Feel free to read more about me and check out my projects. And make sure to check out my contact section - I'd love to connect with you!
